## Overview

FIESTA-II is a powerful tool for disentangling stellar and instrumental variability from exoplanetary Doppler shifts in the Fourier domain. This approach enables more accurate detection of exoplanets by effectively separating planetary signals from various noise sources.

## Publication

Our method is detailed in the paper: [FIESTA II. Disentangling Stellar and Instrumental Variability from Exoplanetary Doppler Shifts in the Fourier Domain](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac77ec/meta)
